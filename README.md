# Hahmo-Dash
Hahmo Dashboard is an internal hub for Lynskey Performance's many needs. 
The dashboard takes on many metrics so users can have a clear and concise idea 
of how the company is performing. Ideally it is a one stop shop for operations as 
one may want to track revenues, operational costs, inventory, promotions, customer feedback
and more.
